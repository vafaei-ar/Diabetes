# Models Directory

Please place your trained scikit-learn model files (ending with `.joblib`) in this directory.

The Gradio application (`app.py`) will automatically detect these models and make them available for selection in the UI.

For example, if you have a model saved as `my_diabetes_model.joblib`, you would place it here:
`models/my_diabetes_model.joblib`
